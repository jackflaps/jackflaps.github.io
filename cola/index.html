    <p>The Colorado Local Authorities (CoLA) project is an effort at the University of Denver Libraries to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>publish metadata about people, organizations, and families represented in our special collections and archives as linked open data</li>
      <li>provide a means for smaller cultural heritage organizations (CHOs) in Colorado and surrounding states to contribute their own data to the store, with the ultimate goal of</li>
      <li>building deeper connections and collaborations among like-minded organizations, independent of size or resources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CoLA is in its early days; we are currently working on reliable RDF exports from our <a href="http://duarchives.coalliance.org">collection management system</a>, and investigating options (whether database or triplestore) for publishing this RDF data on the Web. We are always looking for projects of similar scope with which to share ideas; if you are interested in anything we're working on, feel free to <a href="mailto:kevin.clair@du.edu">e-mail Kevin Clair</a>, Archives Processing Librarian at the University of Denver, to connect.</p>
